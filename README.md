# Random Maze Generator

## Project Overview
This project implements a maze generation algorithm using Depth-First Search (DFS) in Python. It randomly generate a maze and places random start and goal within the maze. The maze is displayed using the `matplotlib` library.

## Dependencies
To run this project, ensure that the `matplotlib` is installed.
To install the package using pip, open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command:
```shell
pip install matplotlib 
```

## Installation
1. Clone Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection repository to local machine:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/wenxie65/Random-Maze-Generator.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```shell
cd Random-Maze-Generator
```
3. Run `maze_generator.ipynb`:
```shell
python maze_generator.ipynb
```

## Result
The result of running the `maze_generator.py` script is the generation of a random-sized maze with random start and goal, can be found in [result.png](result.png). The maze is displayed using pyplot, where walls are represented by black lines. The start position is marked with a green arrow (↑) and the goal position is marked with a red star (★).

To view the result, please refer to the [result.png](result.png) file.
